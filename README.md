# PrivateAccessToken
This is a demonstration  of how NFTs on the XDC network can be used as a method of retrieving private information

NTFs on the XDC network could have a collection of different uses. Like in this example it can be used as a tool to access information locked privately in a smart contract. This data in practice could be identity information, ticket information, Data Accumulated from other DApps, medical data, and much more.

In this Example we have an Access token Able to access a social security number locked in a contract. One thing that could be interesting is being able to pass data from one contract to another keeping your data secure and access restricted to who the token authorizes
