This is a demonstration  of how NFTs on the XDC network can be used as a method of retrieving private information

NTFs on the XDC network could have a collection of different uses. Like in this example it can be used as a tool to access information locked privately in a smart contract. This data in practice could be identity information, ticket information, Data Accumulated from other DApps, medical data, and much more.

In this Example we have an Access token Able to access a social security number locked in a contract. One thing that could be interesting for future DApp, is being able to pass data from one contract to others keeping your data secure and access restricted to who the token authorizes.

Another interesting thing is this application wouldn't be fully possible on most other blockchains, primarily because they are public blockchains where XDC is a hybrid network but also the commodification of data now not accessible to outside users, allowing true privacy for blockchain DApp users who would not like to have all of their data online broadcasted to the rest of the world.
